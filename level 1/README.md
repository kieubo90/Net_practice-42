This exercise show the basic of mask subnet and the IP address:
Since the subnet mask of Interface B1 and A1 is 255.255.255.0 
So the IP address of A1 can be from 1-254 except 12. I mean the last Octet
So the IP of B1 is default: 104.97.23.12 so A1 could be 104.97.23.1 to 104.97.23.254 except 12 since the last octet 12 is reserve for B1 interface
